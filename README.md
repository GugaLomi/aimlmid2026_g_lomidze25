Finding the Correlation

Student: Guram Lomidze
Course: AI and ML for Cybersecurity


The goal of this task is to find Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two variables 
𝑥
x and 
𝑦
y using data extracted from an online graph. The data points were collected manually by hovering over the blue dots on the graph and recording their coordinates.

|   x |   y |
| --: | --: |
|- 9.8 |- 8.5 |
|- 5.8 |- 6.7 |
| -5.0 |- 4.8 |
| -3.0 | -3.1 |
| -1.0 |- 0.9 |
| 1.0 | 0.8 |
| 3.0 | 2.9 |
| 5.0 | 4.7 |
| 7.0 | 6.5 |
| 9.0 | 8.3 |


The correlation was calculated programmatically using Python to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. code is provided in file correlation.Py

Result

The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient is:  0.9964524195013089
